title: Automated microscope
description: "This project started from a desire to improve medical diagnosis in rural communities of low-income countries. In order to contribute in this direction, we decided to design and build a microscopy platform with certain relevant characteristics. We went for microscopy, given its simplicity, versatility, and widespread applications."
# intended-use: "The design is focussed on being accessible to people with physical and
#   cognitive disabilities by use of few and large buttons and simple UI. It
#   should allow anyone to enjoy music without supervision."

development-stage: released
development-plans: "The project has had an initial release, with some ‘field testing’ to boot.
  The hardware and software are functional, if a little rough around some of the edges. 
  Certainly areas to improve on, but none that require immediate attention. All the design
  files and code are available for reproduction - provided you have basic (electronics) tinkering
  skills."
