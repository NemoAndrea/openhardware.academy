development-stage: released
development-plans: "The project has had an initial release, with some ‘field testing’ to boot.
  The hardware and software are functional, if a little rough around some of the edges. 
  Certainly areas to improve on, but none that require immediate attention. All the design
  files and code are available for reproduction - provided you have basic (electronics) tinkering
  skills."
