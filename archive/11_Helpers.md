# Be a helper

**Help needed from helpers**
- Presence in the chat which would require roughly half an hour per week.
- Be open to answer questions from participants when they arise.
- Be open to answer specific questions participant might have about their projects and their exercises.

**Much appreciated if you show up on some of the seminars to inspire participants with your experience**
