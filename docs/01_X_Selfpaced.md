# Getting started self-paced
Hey there! Welcome to the self-paced edition of the OpenHardware Academy. We're excited to have you on board as you embark on your journey to learn about open hardware. Before you dive in, there are a few basic preparations to make sure you get the most out of this program.

## How it works
1. Firstly, you will need to fill out a form to register for the program.

2. Once you are registered, you will receive access to a dedicated Discord group where you can connect with other participants and the program facilitators. This is a great opportunity to ask questions, share resources, progress and challenges in your project. 

3. As you progress through the program, we encourage you to share updates on your projects during our Friday sessions at 12:30 CET Netherlands time. 

4. You can let us know your progress in the Discord group. We encourage you to share progress related to the realization of the exercises.

5. Upon completion of the program, you will receive a certificate of completion. To earn this certificate, you will need to show your completed exercises and present your final project to the program facilitators.

## Self paced approach
- **Make a simple hackmd page** where you collect the exercises by copy pasting them from the lessons and writing them down there as well as your result. **This will be your little openhardware academy journal.** You can also provide links, comments and discuss things there.

:information_source: Why hackmd and not word, or my prefered note taking tools? Markdown is widely use for documentation of software and hardware, and hackmd allows to share notes easily and freely online using markdown. It will make life easy for everybody in the program, trust us :smile: 
:::

- The core of the program is to exercise, therefore we encourage you to focus more on doing the exercises than anything else.

- Interact with people, share and exchange, it will make the journey more fun.

- Get familiar with the program, check what the final presentation is about, this will make you understand better how the exercises provided in each lesson build up towards **the final exercise.**

- Find a buddy that also started the selfpaced edition for peer review activities, as we have some weeks where the focus is on getting feedback from other peers. 

## Get started

This is roughly how your project can evolve in the period of 10 weeks (It could go a bit slower or faster, but we believe this is a doable schedule if you plan to put in between 2 to 4 focused hours).
