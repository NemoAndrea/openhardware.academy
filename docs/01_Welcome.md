# Open Hardware Academy Programme

From the **8th of August until the 14th of October 2022** the Delft Open Hardware community will organize its first round of the Open Hardware Academy!
In this 10 week programme we will help you open up your project to the world. We do this with tips and tricks from our experience, and by simple assignments that help your project to be ready for contributions.

We are convinced that open source can be a promising approach for your project if you are aiming to impact society with technology. Throughout this program we want to help you take advantage of open source design and development practices, techniques and philosophy to translate ideas and prototypes into open hardware projects.

## Layout of the programme
Yes we will touch upon technical things such as 3D printing, PCB design, documentation and licensing, coding, etc, but there is more. **By the end of this program you should be able to do a first release to the public of your open source project!**

* We will help you to work towards a first increment (a publishable and reusable outcome). This can be a first foundational component or prototype for example. We also call this an iteration. This iteration involves several aspects that go from design to documentation.
* We show you an approach to designing and developing for open hardware with exercises where designing and testing is at the center. 
* We share complementary materials and lessons that are open educational resources.
* We will host seminars and workshops addressing specific topics related to open source hardware.
* We discuss and address the different exercises on a weekly basis in collaboration with other fellows that join the program and learn from each other's projects.
* We will host open discussions on the proposed topics, exercises and materials to exchange views on open hardware




### Example projects that would fit
* A Raspberry Pi microscope
* Sewing project
* Woodworking project
* Circular solar panel
* A plastic scanner
* A board game
* Internet sensor
* Origami model
* DIY keyboard
* Bed light
* Chair

## Who can participate?
No matter if you are working on a small or a big project, joining the Open Hardware Academy helps you to understand the mechanics of open and collaborative working. In the 10 weeks you will learn about project management, documentation, community building, prototyping and licenses. By the way, did we tell you itâ€™s free?

### These are our only entry requirements:
- Spend at least half a day per week on the project. This includes participating in the lectures as well as applying the things you learn at the Open Hardware Academy in your own project, ideally around 8 hours.
- Bring your own project
- You are based in the Netherlands

We want anyone to be able to join our Open Hardware Academy, you don't need to be technically skilled!

## What you get in return
- A certificate of participation
- Knowledge on Open source hardware 
- Your own open hardware project
