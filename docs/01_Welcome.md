## What is the Open Hardware Academy?

The Open Hardware Academy is originally conceived as a 10-week program that helps you to develop your own open hardware project. In the 10 weeks participants have learned about project management, documentation, community building, prototyping and licenses for open hardware among other topics. **By the way, did we tell you itâ€™s free?**

Take a look at our [introductory lessons](./07_Lessons.md) with exercises.

We have designed the lessons in such a way that you can do them in your own time. 

We have also developed complementary technical lessons to develop your skills in the field of open hardware.
